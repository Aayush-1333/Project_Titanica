This project aims to initiate a study on the Titanic incident which led to tragedy of several people due to crash of the Titanic cruise ship.

This study will help to understand the impact of the incident and helps to create a predictive model that aims to judge the individual's survival probability based on a certain number of features that will correlate with the target.

## Tech Stack
- Jupyter
- Python and libraries:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn
    - streamlit
- VSCode

## Roadmap
Currently the path of this project is as follows:

- Downloading dataset from Kaggle.
- Studying the dataset and performing data wrangling on it.
- Saving the transformed dataset as CSV file for model development phase.
- Considering classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifiers, SVM.
- Picking up the best model, creating a pipeline and saving it.
- Creating a streamlit app and serving the model along with display of data insights.
